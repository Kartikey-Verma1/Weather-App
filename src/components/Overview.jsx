        This weather application allows users to search for a city and view its current weather and daily forecast.
        The app uses a weather API to fetch real-time data and displays it using a clean, responsive interface built with React.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was created as a learning project to practice building React components, handling user input,
        fetching API data, and managing state. It also demonstrates basic routing and user interaction handling in a single-page application (SPA).
